adb is not in your PATH. This is where the shell looks for executables. You can check your current PATH with echo $PATH.

Bash will first try to look for a binary called adb in your Path, and not in the current directory. Therefore, if you are currently in the platform-tools directory, just call

./adb --help
The dot is your current directory, and this tells Bash to use adb from there.

Otherwise, you should add platform-tools to your PATH, by adding the path in your shell profile, depending on which file is used:

Linux: typically ~/.bashrc
OS X / macOS: typically ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile
Add the following line there and replace the path with the one where you installed platform-tools:

export PATH=/Users/espireinfolabs/Desktop/soft/android-sdk-mac_x86/platform-tools:$PATH
Save the profile file, then, re-start the Terminal or run source ~/.bashrc (or whatever you just modified).

If you've installed the platform tools somewhere else, change the path accordingly. For Android Studio on OS X, for example, you'd use the followingâ€”note the double-quotes that prevent a possible space from breaking the path syntax:

export PATH="/Users/myuser/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools":$PATH

adb logcat MainActivity:V *:S

## Plugman

Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36923980/how-to-add-a-plugin-on-only-one-ionic-platform

Maybe use plugman to add plugin for specific platform:
First,install plugman:

$ npm install -g plugman
And then, add plugin:

$ plugman install --platform <ios|android|blackberry10|wp8> --project <directory> --plugin <name|url|path>
for your situation, <directory> should be platforms/android, so the finally installation command is:

$ plugman install --platform android --project platforms/android --plugin https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation.git
More about plugman, refer to cordova plugman docs.Hope this will help, regards.
